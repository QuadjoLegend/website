# Welcome

Join us online and in person **March 24-26, 2025**, for the nf-core hackathon! 🗓️

The plan is to do an online + distributed hackathon, as held in [2023](/events/2023/hackathon-march-2023) and [2024](/events/2024/hackathon-march-2024).

# Registration

TBA

## Online: Gather

The hackathon is being held in a virtual venue on the platform Gather.
If you have never used Gather before we have [a bytesize video](https://nf-co.re/events/2022/bytesize-37-gathertown) from the March 2022 hackathon that will help you to get started.

Check back soon for more details!

## In person: Local sites

In March 2023 we tried something new: distributed local sites.
It was a massive success, with many people volunteering to organise local groups and great feedback all around.
In 2025 we hope to replicate and build on that success! 🚀

Please use the main registration form to register for a local site!

Your local host will be in contact with you to outline site-specific information.
For the most recent information about your site as well as the contact details of your organizer please check the event page specific to your local sites.

:::info{title="Reminder"}
Even if you are attending a local site you will still join everyone online in Gather.
